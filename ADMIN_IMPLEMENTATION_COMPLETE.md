## 🎯 How It Works

### Admin Workflow:

```
1. Admin goes to http://localhost:5173/admin
2. Logs in with credentials
3. Views dashboard with all orders
4. Sees order with "ORDER_PLACED" status (orange)
5. Clicks "🚚 Mark as Shipped" button
6. Confirms action
7. System automatically:
   • Marks order as shipped
   • Captures ₹ from escrow
   • Initiates payout to cardholder
   • Updates all dashboards
   • Sends notifications
8. Admin sees success message
9. Order status → COMPLETED ✅
```

Body: { email, password }
