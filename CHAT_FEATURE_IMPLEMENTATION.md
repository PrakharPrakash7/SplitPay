# 💬 Chat Feature Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Feature**: Real-time chat between Buyer and Cardholder after order booking  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Testing

---

## 🎯 Overview

Added a real-time chat feature using Socket.io that allows buyers and cardholders to communicate after an order has been placed. Chat is available from `order_placed` status onwards and persists even after deal completion.

---

## 📦 What Was Built

### Backend Changes

#### 1. **ChatMessage Model** (`backend/models/ChatMessage.js`)
- Schema includes:
  - `dealId` - Links message to specific deal
  - `senderId` - User who sent the message
  - `senderRole` - 'buyer' or 'cardholder'
  - `message` - Text content (max 1000 chars)
  - `timestamp` - When message was sent
  - `isRead` - Track read status
- Indexed for efficient querying by deal and timestamp

#### 2. **Chat API Routes** (`backend/routes/chat.js`)
Three endpoints:
- `GET /api/chat/:dealId` - Fetch all messages for a deal
- `POST /api/chat/:dealId` - Send a new message
- `GET /api/chat/:dealId/unread` - Get unread message count

**Security**: 
- Uses `authenticateBuyerOrCardholder` middleware
- Verifies user is part of the deal before allowing access
- Auto-marks messages as read when fetched

#### 3. **Socket.io Events** (`backend/server.js`)
New socket events:
- `join-chat-room` - Join a deal-specific chat room
- `leave-chat-room` - Leave chat room on disconnect
- `send-message` - Emit message to all users in chat room
- `new-message` - Broadcast to all participants

#### 4. **Auth Middleware Update** (`backend/middleware/authMiddleware.js`)
Added `authenticateBuyerOrCardholder` function:
- Validates JWT token
- Checks user role is buyer or cardholder
- Returns 403 for admin or unauthorized roles

---

### Frontend Changes

#### 5. **ChatBox Component** (`frontend/src/components/ChatBox.jsx`)

**Features**:
- 📜 **Message History**: Loads past messages on mount
- 🔄 **Real-time Updates**: Socket.io for instant message delivery
- 🔔 **Notifications**: Toast alerts for new messages from other party
- 📍 **Auto-scroll**: Scrolls to latest message automatically
- 💬 **Chat UI**: 
  - Distinct styling for own vs other's messages
  - Timestamp formatting (Just now, 5m ago, 2h ago, etc.)
  - Character counter (1000 char limit)
  - Loading states
- 🛡️ **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks before adding messages to avoid duplicates

**Props**:
- `dealId` - The deal to chat about
- `userRole` - 'buyer' or 'cardholder' for context

#### 6. **DealFlowModal Integration** (`frontend/src/components/DealFlowModal.jsx`)

Chat is now visible in these stages:
- ✅ `order_tracking` (Buyer - after order placed)
- ✅ `waiting_delivery` (Cardholder - order in transit)
- ✅ `delivery_tracking` (Buyer - out for delivery)
- ✅ `waiting_confirmation` (Cardholder - payment disbursed)
- ✅ `payment_received` (Cardholder - commission received)
- ✅ `completed` (Both - deal finished but chat still accessible)

**Layout**: Chat appears below the main status content in all these stages.

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**: All chat endpoints require valid JWT token
2. **Role-based Access**: Only buyers and cardholders can access chat
3. **Deal Verification**: Users must be part of deal to view/send messages
4. **Message Validation**: 
   - Non-empty messages
   - Max 1000 characters
   - XSS protection via React's built-in escaping
5. **Room Isolation**: Socket rooms are deal-specific (`chat-${dealId}`)
