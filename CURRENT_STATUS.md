## ⏳ **REMAINING WORK** (2 Tasks = ~30 mins)

### **Task 1: Complete BuyerDashboard** ⏰ 15-20 mins
**What's Missing:**
- Socket.io listeners (dealAccepted, orderPlaced, etc.)
- Razorpay payment modal
- "Pay Now" button for matched deals
- AddressForm integration
- Payment verification flow

**Impact:** Without this, buyers can't pay for deals

---

### **Task 2: Complete CardholderDashboard** ⏰ 10-15 mins
**What's Missing:**
- Socket.io listeners (newDeal, addressReceived, etc.)
- Join Socket room on deal acceptance
- OrderSubmissionForm integration
- Real-time deal updates

**Impact:** Without this, cardholders can't receive addresses and submit orders

---

## 🎯 **What You Need To Do Right Now**

### **Option A: Do It Yourself** (Learning Experience)
1. Open `ACTION_PLAN.md`
2. Copy the code from Task 1 into `BuyerDashboard.jsx`
3. Copy the code from Task 2 into `CardholderDashboard.jsx`
4. Test the application

**Time:** 30-40 minutes
**Benefit:** You understand exactly how everything works

---

### **Option B: I Do It For You** (Fast Track)
Just reply with: **"Complete the remaining tasks for me"**

I will:
1. Update `BuyerDashboard.jsx` with full Razorpay + Socket.io code
2. Update `CardholderDashboard.jsx` with Socket.io integration
3. Add navigation buttons to both dashboards

**Time:** 2 minutes
**Benefit:** You can start testing immediately
