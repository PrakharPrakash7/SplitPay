# ‚úÖ Timer System Implementation - COMPLETE

## Overview
Comprehensive multi-stage timer system with automatic expiration and cancellation functionality has been successfully implemented across the entire application.

---

## üéØ Features Implemented

### 1. **Multi-Stage Timer System**
Each stage of the deal has time limits:
- **Stage 1**: Deal creation ‚Üí **5 minutes** (existing)
- **Stage 2**: After acceptance ‚Üí **15 minutes** for payment
- **Stage 3**: After payment ‚Üí **15 minutes** for address sharing
- **Stage 4**: After address shared ‚Üí **15 minutes** for order submission

### 2. **Automatic Expiration**
- Cron job runs every 60 seconds checking all deals
- Automatically expires deals past their time limits
- Automatic refunds for expired deals with payments
- Real-time notifications via Socket.io

### 3. **Manual Cancellation**
- Both buyer and cardholder can cancel deals
- Confirmation dialog before cancellation
- Automatic refunds if payment was authorized
- Cannot cancel after order is shipped
- Notifies other party immediately

### 4. **Visual Timers**
- Countdown displays showing time remaining
- Color-coded status indicators
- Updates every second for live countdown

---

## üìÅ Files Modified

### Backend

#### 1. **models/Deal.js**
Added timer and cancellation fields:
```javascript
paymentExpiresAt: Date,      // 15 min after acceptance
addressExpiresAt: Date,       // 15 min after payment
orderExpiresAt: Date,         // 15 min after address shared
cancelledBy: ObjectId,        // Who cancelled the deal
cancelledAt: Date,            // When it was cancelled
cancelReason: String          // Why it was cancelled
```

#### 2. **controllers/dealsController.js**
Modified `acceptDeal()` function:
- Sets `paymentExpiresAt = Date.now() + 15 minutes` when deal is accepted
- Emits `dealAccepted` event with timer info

#### 3. **routes/payment.js**
**Three endpoints modified:**

a) **POST /verify-payment** (Line ~140)
- Sets `addressExpiresAt = Date.now() + 15 minutes` when payment verified
- Clears `paymentExpiresAt`

b) **POST /share-address** (Line ~235)
- Sets `orderExpiresAt = Date.now() + 15 minutes` when address shared
- Clears `addressExpiresAt`

c) **POST /cancel-deal** (Lines 870-960) - **NEW ENDPOINT**
```javascript
Features:
- Validates user is buyer or cardholder of the deal
- Prevents cancellation after shipping/completion
- Automatic refund if payment was authorized
- Updates deal status to 'expired'
- Emits Socket.io events to notify both parties
- Records cancellation details (who, when, why)
```

#### 4. **utils/dealExpiryChecker.js** - **NEW FILE**
Comprehensive cron job that checks 4 types of expiry:

```javascript
export function checkDealExpiry() {
  // 1. Pending deals (5 min expiry)
  // 2. Matched deals awaiting payment (15 min)
  // 3. Payment authorized awaiting address (15 min + refund)
  // 4. Address shared awaiting order (15 min + refund)
}

export function startExpiryChecker() {
  // Runs checkDealExpiry() every 60 seconds
}
```

**Expiry Logic:**
- Finds deals past their timer
- Updates status to 'expired'
- Processes automatic refunds via Razorpay
- Emits `dealExpired` Socket.io event
- Logs all actions for debugging

#### 5. **server.js**
- Imported `startExpiryChecker`
- Starts checker after MongoDB connects
- Runs continuously in background

---

### Frontend

#### 6. **pages/BuyerDashboard.jsx**

**Added Functions:**
```javascript
// Cancel deal with confirmation
const cancelDeal = async (dealId, reason) => {
  if (!confirm('Are you sure?')) return;
  // Calls /api/payment/cancel-deal
  // Shows success/error toast
  // Refreshes deals
}
```

**Socket.io Listeners:**
```javascript
socket.on("dealExpired", ({ dealId, message }) => {
  toast.error(message);
  fetchDeals();
});

socket.on("dealCancelled", ({ dealId, message }) => {
  toast.info(message);
  fetchDeals();
});
```

**UI Updates:**
- Timer displays for each status:
  - `matched`: Shows payment deadline
  - `payment_authorized`: Shows address deadline
  - `address_shared`: Shows order submission deadline

- Cancel buttons added to:
  - `matched` status: "‚ùå Cancel Deal"
  - `payment_authorized` status: "‚ùå Cancel Deal (Refund)"
  - `address_shared` status: "‚ùå Cancel Deal (Refund)"

#### 7. **pages/CardholderDashboard.jsx**

**Added Functions:**
```javascript
// Cancel deal with confirmation
const cancelDeal = async (dealId, reason) => {
  if (!confirm('Are you sure?')) return;
  // Calls /api/payment/cancel-deal
  // Shows success/error toast
  // Refreshes deals
}
```

**Socket.io Listeners:**
```javascript
socket.on("dealExpired", ({ dealId, message }) => {
  toast.error(message);
  fetchDeals();
});

socket.on("dealCancelled", ({ dealId, message }) => {
  toast.info(message);
  fetchDeals();
});
```

**UI Updates:**
- Timer displays for each status:
  - `matched`: Shows payment deadline (waiting for buyer)
  - `payment_authorized`: Shows address deadline (waiting for buyer)
  - `address_shared`: Shows order submission deadline (cardholder must act)

- Cancel buttons added to:
  - `matched` status: "‚ùå Cancel Deal"
  - `payment_authorized` status: "‚ùå Cancel Deal (Refund Buyer)"
  - `address_shared` status: "‚ùå Cancel Deal (Refund Buyer)"

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

### Cron Job Configuration
```javascript
// Runs every 60 seconds
setInterval(async () => {
  await checkDealExpiry();
}, 60000);
```

### Refund Logic
```javascript
if (deal.razorpayPaymentId) {
  const refund = await razorpay.payments.refund(deal.razorpayPaymentId, {
    amount: deal.totalAmount * 100,
    speed: 'optimum'
  });
  console.log('‚úÖ Refund processed:', refund.id);
}
```

### Socket.io Events
```javascript
// Emitted by backend
- dealExpired: { dealId, message, stage }
- dealCancelled: { dealId, message, cancelledBy }

// Listened by frontend
- Both events trigger:
  1. Toast notification
  2. fetchDeals() to refresh UI
```
