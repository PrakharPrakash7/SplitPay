```

### Technical Flow:

1. **Deal Creation:**
   ```javascript
   // Backend: dealsController.js
   - Scrape product URL
   - Create deal with 1-min expiry
   - Send FCM notification to all cardholders
   - Include deal data in notification payload
   ```

2. **Cardholder Receives:**
   ```javascript
   // Frontend: CardholderDashboard.jsx
   - useFCMForeground hook listens for messages
   - Shows toast notification
   - Calls fetchDeals() to refresh
   - New deals appear instantly
   ```

3. **Deal Acceptance:**
   ```javascript
   // Frontend: CardholderDashboard.jsx
   - Cardholder clicks "Accept Deal"
   - POST /api/deals/:id/accept
   - Backend updates deal status to "matched"
   - Backend sends FCM to buyer
   ```

4. **Buyer Receives:**
   ```javascript
   // Frontend: BuyerDashboard.jsx
   - useFCMForeground hook listens for messages
   - Shows toast: "A cardholder accepted your deal! 🎉"
   - Calls fetchDeals() to refresh
   - Deal status updates to "matched" (green)
   ```

localStorage.getItem('token') // Should have JWT
```

"📨 Foreground message received:"
"🔔 New deal notification received, refreshing..."
"✅ Deals refreshed: X pending"
```

### Check Network Requests:
```javascript
// DevTools Network Tab
GET /api/deals - Should see multiple calls
POST /api/deals/:id/accept - When accepting
POST /api/users/fcm - FCM token registration
```
