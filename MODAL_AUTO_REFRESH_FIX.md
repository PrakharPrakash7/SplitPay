# Modal Auto-Refresh Fix

## Problem
The DealFlowModal was not automatically refreshing when deal status changed via socket events. Users had to manually reload the page to see updates. Additionally, the modal was closing at inappropriate times instead of only when the deal reached specific final states.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Socket Event Handlers Updated (Both Dashboards)
All socket event listeners now:
- **Fetch latest deals** after every event
- **Update the modal** if it's currently open for the affected deal
- **Auto-close modal** only for specific final states

### 2. Modal Auto-Close Logic
The modal now **automatically closes** only when deal reaches these states:
- ✅ `order_placed` - When cardholder places the order
- ❌ `cancelled` - When deal is cancelled by either party
- ⏰ `expired` - When deal expires due to timeout
- 💸 `refunded` - When payment is refunded
- ⚠️ `failed` - When deal fails

### 3. Modal Auto-Refresh Logic
The modal now **automatically refreshes** (stays open with updated content) for:
- 🎉 `dealAcceptedByCardholder` - Cardholder accepts deal
- 💰 `paymentAuthorized` - Buyer completes payment
- 📍 `addressReceived` - Buyer shares shipping address
- 🚚 `orderShipped` - Order is shipped
- ✅ `paymentCaptured` - Payment is captured from escrow
- 💸 `payoutInitiated` - Payout is initiated to cardholder
- 🎊 `dealCompleted` - Deal is marked as completed

## Changes Made

### BuyerDashboard.jsx
1. **Socket Event Handlers**: All event listeners now update modal state
   - `dealAcceptedByCardholder` → Updates modal
   - `paymentAuthorized` → Updates modal
   - `orderSubmitted` → Updates modal + closes after 2s
   - `orderShipped` → Updates modal
   - `paymentCaptured` → Updates modal
   - `dealExpired` → Closes modal after 2s
   - `dealCancelled` → Closes modal after 2s
   - `dealCompleted` → Updates modal

2. **onSuccess Callback**: Updated to only close modal for `order_placed`, `cancelled`, `expired`, `refunded`, `failed`

### CardholderDashboard.jsx
1. **Socket Event Handlers**: All event listeners now update modal state
   - `newDeal` → Refreshes deals
   - `dealAccepted` → Closes modal if open
   - `paymentAuthorized` → Updates modal
   - `addressReceived` → Updates or opens modal with address data
   - `orderShipped` → Updates modal
   - `paymentCaptured` → Updates modal
   - `payoutInitiated` → Updates modal
   - `dealExpired` → Closes modal after 2s
   - `dealCancelled` → Closes modal after 2s
   - `dealCompleted` → Updates modal

2. **onSuccess Callback**: Updated to only close modal for `order_placed`, `cancelled`, `expired`, `refunded`, `failed`

## Benefits

✅ **Real-time Updates**: Modal content updates automatically without page reload
✅ **Smart Auto-Close**: Modal closes only at appropriate times (order placed, cancelled, expired)
✅ **Seamless UX**: Users see status changes instantly
✅ **No Manual Refresh**: All state transitions visible without user intervention
✅ **Consistent Behavior**: Both buyer and cardholder dashboards behave identically

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Buyer creates deal → Modal shows waiting state
- [ ] Cardholder accepts deal → Both modals update automatically
- [ ] Buyer makes payment → Both modals update automatically
- [ ] Buyer shares address → Cardholder modal updates with address
- [ ] Cardholder submits order → Modal closes automatically after 2s
- [ ] Deal cancelled → Modal closes automatically after 2s
- [ ] Deal expired → Modal closes automatically after 2s
- [ ] Multi-tab test: Changes in one tab reflect in other tabs
- [ ] Socket reconnection: Updates work after network interruption

## Technical Details

### Modal Update Flow
```
Socket Event Received
    ↓
fetchDeals() called → Updates main deals list
    ↓
Check if modal is open for this deal
    ↓
If yes → Fetch latest deal data
    ↓
Update modalDeal/selectedDeal state
    ↓
Modal re-renders with new data
    ↓
If final state → Close after 2s delay
```

### Role-Specific Authentication
All API calls use `getAuthToken(role)` to ensure proper authentication:
- Buyer: `getAuthToken('buyer')`
- Cardholder: `getAuthToken('cardholder')`

This ensures modal updates work correctly even with multiple tabs open for different roles.
